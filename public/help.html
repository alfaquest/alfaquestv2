	ΑLΦΑQUΕSΤ GAME OBJECTIVE:  
	</h2>
	<p style="color:cyan;font-family: Monospace;font-size:12pt">
	Navigate through a sequence of words from a stated category.  
	Each word must begin with a unique starting letter. 
	<br>
	<br>
	For example the prototype category 'Countries of the world' contains 24 possible starting alphabetic letters. 
	So to win the game you must run an unbroken sequence of all 24 letters in an order determined by in-game choices.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style="color:cyan;font-family: Monospace;font-size:12pt">
	The starting letter of each word (not counting the first, which will always be the letter 'A'),  
	is decided by its position within, and availability from the previously  
	selected word in the game. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2 style="color:cyan;font-family: Monospace;font-size:14pt">
	EXAMPLE: 
	</h2>
	<p style="color:cyan;font-family: Monospace;;font-size:12pt">
	If selected Answer 1 in the sequence is for example 'Albania'. <br><br>
	Answer 2 in the sequence must then begin with the letter 'l': <br>the 2nd letter in 'Albania'. <br><br>
	However if selected Answer 2 is then 'Latvia'. <br> <br>
	Answer 3 cannot begin with previously used letter 'a' from Answer 1: <br>the 2nd letter in 'Latvia'. <br><br>
	So 'a' is now skipped and we move on to the next unused letter in Latvia, the letter 't', which could lead for example to an Answer 3 choice of 'Turkey','Thailand' or 'Tonga', requiring Answer 4 to then begin respectively with any of the following letters: 'u', 'h' or 'o'. <br><br>
	If Answer 3 selection was instead 'Tanzania', then Answer 4 must begin with letter 'n'.<br><br>
	The fundamental rule of ALΦAQUEST is that the first letter must always be unique throughout the sequence. <br><br>
	In the protoype category 'Countries of the world', a succesful sequence must contain 24 words, with 24 unique starting letters, 
	as no country in the world starts with the letters 'W' or 'X'.
</p>
<br>
	<h2 style="color:cyan;font-family: Monospace;font-size:14pt">
	GAME PROGRESSION: 
</h2>
	<p style="color:cyan;font-family: Monospace;font-size:12pt">	
	As the game progresses, it is possible for the next starting letter to  
	be contained in position 4, 5, 10 or even position 20 of the previously  
	selected word. 
</p>
<br>
	<p style="color:cyan;font-family: Monospace;font-size:12pt">
	The game will continue until all starting letters have been navigated  
	successfully in sequence, a glorious victory! Or if a game terminating  
	dead end is reached, a not dishonourable failure. 
</p>
<br>
	<p style="color:cyan;font-family: Monospace;font-size:12pt">
	A dead end is a scenario in which the most recent chosen word consists  
	of only previously used first letters, leaving the player with no available letters to continue,  
	resulting in an unsuccessful game. 
</p>
<br>
	<p style="color:cyan;font-family: Monospace;font-size:12pt">
	Good luck and no cheating, not that it will help you much!
