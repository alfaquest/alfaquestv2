		<h1>GAME OBJECTIVE: </h1>
		<p id ="paragraph1">
 
	<br>

	Navigate through a sequence or route of words from a stated category.  
	Each word must begin with a unique starting letter. The first starting letter will always be 'A', the following starting letters will be determined by subsequent player choices.
	<br>
	<br>
	For example the prototype category 'Countries of the world' contains 24 possible starting alphabetic letters. 
	So to win the game you must run an unbroken sequence of all 24 available letters in an order determined by in-game decisions.
	<br>
	<br>
	The starting letter of each word (not counting the first, which to repeat will always be the letter 'A'),  
	is decided by its position within, and availability from the previously  
	selected word in the game. 
	<br>
	<br>
There are potentially thousands of sequences which can be followed inside ALΦAQUEST, however only a handful of these sequences will result in a successfully completed game.<br>
	<h2>EXAMPLE: </h2> 
	<p id ="paragraph2">
		<br>
		The following sequence will result in 'Game Over' for a player after 5 of the possible 24 rounds: <br><br>
1. Albania<br>
2. Latvia<br>
3. Tonga<br>
4. Oman<br>
5. Malta<br><br>
This is because all letters in 'Malta' have been used as starting letters up to this point.<br><br>
'M' for 'Malta', 'A' for 'Albania', 'L' for 'Latvia' & 'T' for 'Tonga', there are no unused starting letters within 'Malta' remaining to continue the game.<br><br>
You can see selection of Latvia in answer 2 results in next starting letter of 'T' for answer 3, as letter 'A' was already used for answer 1.<br><br>

The following sequence will not result in Game Over after 5 rounds: <br><br>
1. Albania<br>
2. Latvia<br>
3. Tonga<br>
4. Oman<br>
5. Malaysia<br><br>
The game now continues to round 6 with the next available letter contained inside the word 'Malaysia', which is 'y'. <br> You must now think of a country beginning with the letter 'Y' to proceed to round 7. Letters 's' and 'i' do not come into play at this point.
<br>
<br>
<i>Top tip: Track your game progress by keeping a close eye on "used/next starting letter" fields.</i> </p>
<h2>
	GAME PROGRESSION: 
	</h2>
	<p id ="paragraph3">
		<br>
	As the game progresses, it is possible for the next starting letter to  
	be contained in position 4, 5, 10 or even position 20 of the previously  
	selected word. 
<br><br>
	The game will continue until all starting letters have been navigated  
	successfully in sequence, a glorious victory! Or if a game terminating  
	dead end is reached, a not too dishonourable failure. 
<br><br>
	A dead end is a scenario in which the most recent chosen word consists  
	of only previously used first letters, leaving the player with no available letters to continue,  
	resulting in an unsuccessful game. 

<br><br>
	Good luck and no cheating, not that it will help you much!
